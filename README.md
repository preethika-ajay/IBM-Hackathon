# Detection of Cerebral NEOPLASM from magnetic resonance imaging using ML models  

A brain tumour is a malignant disease with a high mortality ratio, occurring when one or more tissues in the brain become malignant and start growing unusually. Moreover, it disturbs the brainâ€™s normal function and other neighbouring tissues. The detection of tumours depends on the size and position of the malignant tissue. Our problem statement is that the automated identification of brain tumours at an early stage is a difficult task in MRI images. On giving the input as an MRI scan image of the brain,our model outputs whether the patient is suffering from Cerebral Neoplasm or not.
